# How to Become a GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst (GCIA) with SANS SEC503 Course
 
If you are interested in network monitoring, threat detection, and intrusion analysis, you may want to consider pursuing the GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst (GCIA) certification. This credential validates your skills and knowledge in configuring and monitoring intrusion detection systems, and analyzing network traffic and log files. GCIA certification holders are able to identify emerging threats, perform threat hunting, and reconstruct network attacks.
 
One of the best ways to prepare for the GCIA certification exam is to take the SANS SEC503: Network Monitoring and Threat Detection In-Depth course. This course delivers the technical knowledge, insight, and hands-on training you need to confidently defend your network, whether traditional or cloud-based. You will learn about the underlying theory of TCP/IP and the most used application protocols, as well as how to use the most important and widely used automated threat detection and mitigation tools in the industry.

The SANS SEC503 course aligns with the GCIA certification exam objectives and provides you with a comprehensive study guide and practice tests. The exam consists of 150 questions that you have to answer in four hours. The passing score is 68.9%. The exam tests your ability to:

- Analyze traffic at the packet level
- Analyze traffic from common application protocols
- Analyze traffic from various network security devices
- Detect anomalous and malicious activity on the network
- Perform network forensics and reconstruction

If you want to become a GCIA certified professional, you can register for the SANS SEC503 course online or in person at various locations around the world. You can also choose from different training formats, such as live online, on-demand, or simulcast. The course fee includes access to the course materials, labs, practice tests, and one attempt at the GCIA certification exam.
 
The SANS SEC503 course is not for beginners or for people who want to learn how to use out-of-the-box network monitoring tools. It is for those who want to deeply understand how network protocols work and how to identify both zero-day and known threats on their network. It is for those who want to become proficient in network monitoring, threat detection, and intrusion analysis.
