> "I am not that big on religious films, but this is one of two Hindi films dealing with Hindu deities that are well-done, tasteful, and inspirational in the way devotional films should be (the other film being Gopal Krishna.) Hinduism recognizes three separate 'paths' or 'connections' between the mortal world and the immortal. The most modern of these (a youthful 2,500 years old) is called 'bhakti' or devotion, where devotees maintain a personal and spiritual connection to a god/goddess, or several. Jai Santoshi Maa demonstrates this 'bhakti' element in modern Hindu life quite well." - rnsharma on IMDb

> "This was one of my favorite films during my childhood. Even today I can't watch it without being moved to tears. It's a lovely film about devotion and faith winning over malice and jealousy. The Director also made the film Gopal Krishna which was another of my favorites. I just wish that films like these two were made today as well, instead of the meaningless rubbish that makes up so much of Hindi cinema these days." - jedi953 on IMDb

> "Jai Santoshi Maa is a classic film that has a timeless appeal. It shows how faith can overcome any difficulty and how devotion can bring joy and peace. The film is a tribute to the goddess who is the embodiment of satisfaction and contentment. The film is also a cultural treasure that showcases the rich traditions and values of India." - letterboxd user
