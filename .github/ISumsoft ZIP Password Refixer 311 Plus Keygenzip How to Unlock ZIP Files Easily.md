## Step 3: Choose a password attack type
 
ISumsoft ZIP Password Refixer 311 Plus Keygenzip offers four password attack types: Normal, Mask, Dictionary, and Smart. You can choose one of them based on your knowledge of the password.
 
- **Normal:** This type will try all possible combinations of characters until it finds the password. It is the most comprehensive but also the slowest method. You can set some parameters such as password length, character range, prefix, and suffix to speed up the process.
- **Mask:** This type will try passwords according to a mask that you specify. A mask is a part of the password that you remember or guess. For example, if you know that the password starts with "a" and ends with "z", you can set the mask as "a????z". This type is faster than Normal but requires some clues about the password.
- **Dictionary:** This type will try passwords from a built-in or customized dictionary file. A dictionary file is a text file that contains a list of common or frequently used passwords. This type is faster than Mask but requires that the password is in the dictionary file.
- **Smart:** This type will try passwords based on some common patterns or rules. It is the fastest but also the least effective method. It is suitable for simple or weak passwords.

You can click the "Settings" button next to each attack type to configure some options.
 
## Step 4: Start to unlock the ZIP file
 
After choosing a password attack type, click the "Start" button to begin the password recovery process. The software will display the progress, speed, and estimated time on the interface. You can pause or stop the process at any time.
