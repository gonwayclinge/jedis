## Radar Column Series for RadChartView
 
RadChartView is a powerful and flexible charting component that supports various types of series, axes, annotations, legends, and interactivity. In the R1 2018 SP1 release, a new series type was added: the Radar Column Series. This series allows you to display data in a circular layout with columns radiating from the center. You can use this series to compare multiple variables or categories in a compact and visually appealing way.
 
To use the Radar Column Series, you need to add a PolarAxis and a RadialAxis to the chart view, and then add one or more RadarColumnSeries objects with the data points. You can customize the appearance of the columns by setting properties such as BorderColor, BorderWidth, DrawFill, FillColor, etc.

## CheckBox Alignment for GridViewCheckBoxColumn
 
RadGridView is a versatile and feature-rich grid control that allows you to display and manipulate tabular data with ease. It supports various types of columns, such as text, numeric, date-time, image, combo box, check box, etc. In the R1 2018 SP1 release, a new property was added to the GridViewCheckBoxColumn: CheckBoxAlignment. This property allows you to control the horizontal alignment of the check box within the cell. You can choose from three values: Near, Center, or Far.
 
To use the CheckBoxAlignment property, you need to set it to the desired value for each GridViewCheckBoxColumn object in your grid view. You can also use the CellFormatting event to apply different alignments based on some condition.
 
## Spread Export of Image Columns
 
RadGridView also supports exporting its data to various formats, such as Excel, PDF, CSV, HTML, etc. In the R1 2018 SP1 release, a new feature was added to the SpreadExport functionality: the ability to export image columns. This feature allows you to preserve the images that are displayed in your grid view when exporting to Excel or PDF formats.
 
To use this feature, you need to enable the ExportImages property of the SpreadExportRenderer object that you use for exporting. You can also set the ImageQuality property to control the compression level of the images in the exported file.
