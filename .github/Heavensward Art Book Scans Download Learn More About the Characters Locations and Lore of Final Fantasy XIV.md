If you are a fan of Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward, you might be interested in getting a copy of the official art book for the game. The art book, titled *The Art of Ishgard - Stone and Steel*, features hundreds of full-color illustrations of the characters, environments, weapons, and creatures from the expansion. It also comes with an exclusive bonus item code that you can redeem in-game for a special minion.
 
However, the art book is not cheap. It costs $39.99 on the official Square Enix store, and it might be hard to find in other places. Plus, you might not want to wait for the shipping or deal with the hassle of physical books. So, is there a way to download Heavensward art book scans for free?

The answer is yes, but it is not legal or ethical. Some people have scanned the art book and uploaded it online as a PDF file.
