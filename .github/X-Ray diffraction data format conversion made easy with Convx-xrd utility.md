# How to Convert XRD Files with ConvX
 
XRD files are data files that contain information about the X-ray diffraction patterns of materials. XRD files can be generated by different instruments and software, such as Rigaku, Bruker-AXS, DiffracPlus, etc. However, not all XRD files are compatible with each other or with other analysis tools. Therefore, you may need to convert XRD files to different formats depending on your needs.
 
One of the easiest and most convenient ways to convert XRD files is to use ConvX, a free Windows program that can read and write various XRD file formats. ConvX can convert XRD files from Rigaku, Bruker-AXS, DiffracPlus, FullProf, GSAS, and more. You can also convert multiple files in one easy operation with ConvX.
