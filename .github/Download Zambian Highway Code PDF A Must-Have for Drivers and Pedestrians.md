In this article, we will look at some of the main topics covered by the Zambian Highway Code and why they are important for road users. These topics include:

1. Road signs and markings: These are symbols and lines that communicate information, warnings, instructions and directions to road users. They help to regulate traffic flow, prevent accidents and ensure safety. Road users should know the meaning and purpose of different road signs and markings and obey them at all times.
2. Speed limits: These are the maximum or minimum speeds that road users are allowed to travel on different roads or sections of roads. They are determined by factors such as road conditions, traffic volume, visibility and safety. Speed limits help to reduce the risk of collisions, injuries and fatalities. Road users should always drive within the speed limits and adjust their speed according to the circumstances.
3. Driving rules and regulations: These are the laws and rules that govern the behavior and conduct of road users on the road. They include rules on overtaking, lane discipline, right of way, traffic lights, roundabouts, junctions, parking, loading and unloading, seat belts, child car seats, mobile phones, alcohol and drugs, etc. Driving rules and regulations help to maintain order, discipline and respect on the road. Road users should always comply with the driving rules and regulations and avoid committing any traffic offences.
4. Vehicle maintenance: This is the process of keeping a vehicle in good working condition and ensuring that it meets the required standards of safety and performance. It includes checking and servicing the engine, brakes, tyres, lights, mirrors, wipers, horn, battery, etc. Vehicle maintenance helps to prevent breakdowns, malfunctions and accidents. Road users should always maintain their vehicles regularly and ensure that they have valid certificates of fitness and test certificates.
5. Road user behaviour: This is the attitude and manner that road users display on the road. It includes being courteous, cooperative, patient and considerate of other road users. It also involves avoiding risky or aggressive actions such as speeding, tailgating, cutting in, honking unnecessarily, etc. Road user behaviour affects the safety and comfort of everyone on the road. Road users should always behave responsibly and positively on the road and set a good example for others.
